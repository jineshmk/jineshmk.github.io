<h2><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Dengue fever - including symptoms, treatment, and prevention</strong></span></h2>
<p id="E275"><span id="E276">Dengue fever is an infection caused by dengue viruses, of which there are four different serotypes known to infect humans.</span><span id="E278">Dengue fever occurs in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, including northern Australia.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>How dengue fever is spread</strong></span></p>
<p id="E281" style="text-align: justify;"><span id="E282">In Australia the dengue virus is transmitted by a bite from the </span><span id="E284">Aedes</span><span id="E286"> </span><span id="E288">aegypti</span><span id="E290"> mosquito. Only the female mosquito transmits the dengue virus. This mosquito is a daytime biter, both inside and outside homes, and is most active in the hours after sunrise and before sunset. Other species of mosquito can transmit the virus but are not presently established in Australia.</span></p>
<p id="E291" style="text-align: justify;"><span id="E293">Aedes</span><span id="E295"> </span><span id="E297">aegypti</span><span id="E299"> mosquitoes breed inside and outside the home in containers holding water and rarely fly more than 200 metres from the breeding site. They do not breed in creeks, swamps, pools or other bodies of water.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Signs and symptoms</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The disease has a sudden onset and symptoms may include:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li id="E304"><span id="E308">fever</span><span id="E310"> for 3 to 7 days</span></li>
<li id="E311"><span id="E315">intense</span><span id="E317"> headache and pain behind the eyes</span></li>
<li id="E318"><span id="E322">muscle</span><span id="E324"> and joint pain</span></li>
<li id="E325"><span id="E327">&nbsp;</span><span id="E329">loss</span><span id="E331"> of appetite</span></li>
<li id="E332"><span id="E335">&nbsp;</span><span id="E336">vomiting and diarrhoea</span></li>
<li id="E337"><span id="E339">&nbsp;</span><span id="E341">skin</span><span id="E343"> rash</span></li>
<li id="E344"><span id="E348">&nbsp;</span><span id="E349">bleeding, usually from the nose or gums.</span></li>
</ul>
<p id="E355"><strong><span id="E356" style="color: #008000;">Diagnosis</span></strong></p>
<p id="E357"><span id="E358">Diagnosis of dengue fever is made by clinical presentation and a blood test.</span></p>
<p id="E359"><strong><span id="E360" style="color: #008000;">Incubation period</span></strong></p>
<p id="E361"><span id="E362">(</span><span id="E364">time</span><span id="E366"> between becoming infected and developing symptoms)</span></p>
<p id="E367"><span id="E368">3 to 14 days, commonly 4 to 7 days.</span></p>
<p id="E370"><strong><span id="E371" style="color: #008000;">Infectious period</span></strong></p>
<p id="E372"><span id="E373">(</span><span id="E375">time</span><span id="E377"> during which an infected person can infect others)</span></p>
<p id="E378"><span id="E379">A mosquito becomes infected if it bites an infected person while the fever is present (an average period of about 3 to 5 days).</span></p>
<p id="E380"><span id="E381">After biting an infected person it takes 8 to 12 days before the mosquito can infect other people.</span></p>
<p id="E382"><span id="E383">The mosquito remains infectious for life.</span></p>
<p id="E384"><span id="E385">Dengue fever is not directly spread from person-to-person.</span></p>
<p id="E386"><strong><span id="E387" style="color: #008000;">Treatment</span></strong></p>
<p id="E388"><span id="E389">There is no specific antiviral treatment available.</span></p>
<p id="E390"><span id="E391">General recommendations include controlling fever and pain with paracetamol rather than aspirin (aspirin may promote bleeding), and increasing fluid intake. Aspirin should not be given to children under 12 years of age unless specifically recommended by a doctor.</span></p>
<p id="E392"><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span id="E393">Prevention</span></strong></span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li id="E394"><span id="E398">Exclusion from childcare, preschool, school or work is usually not necessary but people experiencing fever from dengue infection should not be in an environment where they may be bitten by mosquitoes. If this is not possible they should stay at home until they have no fever and are therefore no longer infectious (usually 3 to 5 days).</span></li>
<li id="E399"><span id="E403">There</span><span id="E405"> is no vaccine to prevent human infection by this virus.</span></li>
<li id="E406"><span id="E410">Personal protection and the environmental management of mosquitoes are important in preventing illness.</span></li>
<li id="E411"><span id="E416">Prevent access of mosquitoes to an infected person with a fever.</span></li>
<li id="E418"><span id="E422">Protect </span><span id="E424">yourself</span><span id="E426"> from mosquito bites at all times in dengue areas. For tips on how to protect yourself, see Fight the Bite.</span></li>
