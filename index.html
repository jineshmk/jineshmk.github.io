<h2>TCOB- Temporal Constrained Objects </h2>

<p>
Temporal constrained objects is an extension of the paradigm of constrained objects which provides a principled approach to modeling complex engineering systems based upon two main principles: a compositional specification of the structure of the system, using objects, and a declarative specification of its behavior, using constraints. 
</p>
<p>
A novel feature of temporal constrained objects is the series variable, the sequence of whose values is determined by constraints that include metric temporal operators. The emergent behavior of a dynamic system is determined through a process of time-based simulation and constraint satisfaction at each step.

<h4> AC Circuit</h4>
</p>
<p>
Unlike DC circuit in example, the voltage in AC circuits vary with time, typically alternating between positive and negative values according to some pattern. We define the voltage (V) and current (I) in the abstract class component as series variables to model this periodic change. The three types of circuit components (resistor, capacitor, and inductor) each inherit voltage and current from the component class. The constraints in each class define the laws of circuit elements: the inductor class implements Faraday’s law of inductance, i.e., the voltage (V) across an inductor is equal to the inductance (L) multiplied by the rate of change of current (I); similarly the capacitor class implements Ampere’s law of capacitance, i.e., the current (I) through a capacitor is equal to the capacitance (C) multiplied by the rate of change of voltage (V).
