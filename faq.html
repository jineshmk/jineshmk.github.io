<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">How this application works? </span></strong></p>
<p>This application works in response to the user input. User can select the any locality (Panchayat/Municipality/Corporation) in Trivandrum district from the dropdown list provided and the application can predict the Dengue fever risk factor in the select area based on a mathematical model works behind the application</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Will the application use for any locality?</span></strong><span id="E245"><br />Currently this application works in a boundary of a</span><span id="E246">Panchayat/Municipality/Corporation</span><span id="E247">. All the calculations are based on a defined area and using the survey details and documented dengue fever incidents for the previous years. We are planning to implement independent location based prediction in the next update of the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>How can I use this application on my mobile?</strong></span><br />This application can be installed very easily in your mobile phone as same as any other application you install in your phone.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">What mathematical model work with this application?</span></strong><span id="E255"><br />This application uses a SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Recovered) model behind. SEIR</span><span id="E257">model is</span><span id="E259"> a an accurate model to predict the epidemic caused by infectious diseases. This mathematical model was build based on the Dengue fever occurrences and climatic factors implemented in a host vector compartmental model. </span></p>
